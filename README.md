# customer-churn-prediction
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that performs a complete analysis of customer churn. The goal of the project is to understand which customers are likely to leave a service and what factors influence their decision.

Files Included
customer_churn_code.ipynb
This is the main notebook. It includes data loading, cleaning, visualization, model building, and churn prediction steps.

Project Description
This project focuses on analyzing customer behavior using machine learning.
Inside the notebook, you will find:
Data preprocessing and handling missing values
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with charts
Feature selection and model training
Evaluation of the model using accuracy and other metrics
Final churn prediction results
The notebook is written in a clear step-by-step format, so you can easily follow the workflow.

How to Use the Notebook
Install Python and Jupyter Notebook (or Jupyter Lab).
Open the notebook file:
customer_churn_code.ipynb
Run each cell in order to reproduce the analysis and predictions.
You can modify the data or model parameters to experiment with your own improvements.

Requirements
To run the notebook, you should have the following Python libraries installed:
pandas
numpy
matplotlib
scikit-learn
seaborn (optional, only if used in visuals)
You can install them with:
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn seaborn

Purpose of This Repository
This repository is meant to serve as a simple project demonstrating:
Basic data science workflow
Customer churn prediction using machine learning
Clean and readable notebook-based analysis
